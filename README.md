# Kyber-512-optimization

This project aims at reducing the area and latency of the Kyber 512 cryptographic algorithm.

The main optimizations performed in this are:

-> Bottle Neck Identification

-> Pipelining

-> Loop Unrolling

-> Memory Optimization

The target FPGA board used is Artix 7 xc7a200tfbg676-2

This has been done using Vivado Hls 2019.
